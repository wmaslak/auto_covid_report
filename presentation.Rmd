```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Plan

- Result
- Technical stuff
- Process

## Result

- Automated report comparing the course of pandemics across countries 
- Many parameters, lots of posibilities
- Let's see it!

## Technical stuff - using others' work

-Brilliant COVID-19 Data Hub project and package (also for Python, Scala, Matlab and others!)

-World Bank data (a bit crooked implementation, had to do a workaround)

-DTW (Dynamic time warping)

## DTW
```{r, out.height= "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/warp.jpg")
```


## Technical stuff - setup

-Structured Rmd (master + sections)

-R virtual environment

-HTML vs PDF

## Technical stuff - reproducibility threats

- Data changes?

- Vintage parameter!

- Data disappers?

- Don't use it!

- Some parameters throw error because something is badly coded?

- Quite likely! Use different parameters :)

## Process

- My (bad) coding habits

- Structure + planning

- DDD (Documentation driven development)

- Terrifying! (but effective)

- Learned a lot!

## Thank you!
- Questions?
