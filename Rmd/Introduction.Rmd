# Introduction

From Wikipedia:

>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was
identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide,
leading to a pandemic.

This report aims to provide insight into the differences in the course of the pandemic in differences countries through simple and informative summaries and graphics.

The report focuses on the following list of countries:
```{r countries used, results='asis'}
for (cnt in country_names) {
  cat(
    paste0('\n',
          '* ',
          '**',cnt,'**')
    )
}

```


in the period **`r params$start_date`** to **`r params$end_date`**

 I changed my mind.
```{r}
knitr::kable(summary(data))
```
